        <h1>Recipe 3: Cool and Delicious Homemade Ice Cream</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If you have an ice cream machine that has to be cooled before churning, put it in the freezer the night before.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with water and ice and place a smaller bowl in it with fine-mesh strainer inside.</li>
            <li>Place 4 egg yolks and 2/3 cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 1/2 cups milk into a medium saucepan and place over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Split 1 vanilla bean lengthwise, scrape the seeds into the milk, and add the pod (or just add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract).</li>
            <li>Bring the milk to a simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li> Ladle out about 1 cup of the hot milk (no need to be exact). While whisking constantly, slowly pour it into the egg-sugar mixture.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the tempered egg-sugar mixture into the saucepan with the remaining milk.</li>
            <li>Return the saucepan to low heat.</li>
            <li>Stir the mixture slowly, but constantly, scraping the bottom and sides of the pot.</li>
            <li>Keep cooking until the base has thickened enough to coat the back of the spatula and registers 170°F with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
            <li>Pour the base through the reserved fine-mesh strainer set over the bowl to remove the vanilla pod and any bits of egg that may have accidentally curdled.</li>
            <li>Remove the strainer, making sure to scrape any base that clings to the underside of the strainer off into the rest of the base.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 1/2 cups heavy cream into the ice cream base.</li>
            <li>Leave the ice cream base over the ice water bath, stirring occasionally, until completely chilled, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Alternatively, cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to overnight.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Transfer the ice cream base to the bowl of your ice cream machine.</li>
            <li>Churn until the base has thickened to a consistency somewhere between a very thick milkshake and soft-serve ice cream.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In most ice cream makers, this takes about 20 minutes — check the instructions for your particular machine.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to a freezer container.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Press a piece of wax paper against the surface of the ice cream to prevent ice crystals from forming.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Put into a bowl or cone and add toppings and enjoy!</li>
