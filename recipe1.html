        <h1>Recipe #1: A Delicious and Simple Homemade Burger!</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup Italian Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Milk</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Ketchup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat grill to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>If you don't have a grill, or the weather isn't cooperating, the oven works just fine. Preheat to 375 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Start by mixing all of the ingredients together in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Once ingredients are thoroughly mixed, separate into four equally sized balls and press down to form patties.</li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>(Note: the burgers will get thicker as they cook, so make them a little thinner than you want the finished product to be.) </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Season both sides generously with Garlic Salt and Black Pepper.</li>
            <li>Grill for about 5 minutes per side (or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees fahrenheit).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If baking, simply transfer to a baking sheet lined with foil/parchment paper and bake for 20 minutes (No need to flip them).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Finally, tent the burgers under foil and let them rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Now is the perfect time to add cheese as it will be nice and melted by the time the burgers are finished resting.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, this is the perfect opportunity to toast your buns if desired, prepare toppings, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
